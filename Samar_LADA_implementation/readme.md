# LADA Implementation


- As our main focus paper LIDA makes sentence level embeddings, that is simulated by a BERTtokenizer which was inbuilt in the pretrained model, that will be replaced by our own embedding creation of Lida

- Then the idea of LADA is implemented in those same embeddings where with KMEANS cluster algorithm the most similar augmented points (embeddings) are selected.
